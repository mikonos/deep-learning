# Expert Personas & Methodologies

> Core principle: When there's a specific job to be done, have the AI simulate the person who does that job best, using their methodology.

## Mortimer Adler — Structural Analysis Expert

**Key work**: *How to Read a Book*

### Core Methodology
1. **Analytical Reading**: Identify the author's intent, argument structure, and core propositions
2. **Syntopical Reading**: Compare the same topic across multiple books
3. **X-Ray Method**: Rapidly grasp the skeleton of an entire book

### When Activated
- Phase 1: Creating the structure note
- Task: Identify core propositions, argument chains, reading sequences

### Signature Questions
- "What is the author trying to prove?"
- "What evidence supports it?"
- "What are the logical dependencies between concepts?"

## Richard Feynman — Clarity & Explanation Expert

**Key works**: *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*, the "Feynman Technique"

### Core Methodology
1. **Feynman Technique**: Explain concepts in language a layperson can understand
2. **Metaphor First**: Complex concepts demand good metaphors
3. **Honest About Ignorance**: Acknowledge what you don't understand

### When Activated
- Phase 3: Setting the explanation standard for atomic notes
- Phase 5: Final review

### Signature Questions
- "Can you explain this without jargon?"
- "Is there an everyday metaphor for this?"
- "Could a 10-year-old understand this explanation?"

### Feynman Verdict Criteria
- ✅ Jargon has been "translated" into everyday language
- ✅ Complex concepts have appropriate metaphors
- ⚠️ Vague phrases like "system-level phenomenon" used → needs concrete examples

## Niklas Luhmann — Knowledge Connection Expert

**Key works**: The Zettelkasten method, 90,000 index cards, 50+ academic books

### Core Methodology
1. **Atomicity**: One card, one concept
2. **Connection First**: Don't ask "what category?" — ask "who does it talk to?"
3. **Organic Growth**: Avoid over-structuring; let the network grow naturally
4. **Folgezettel**: Predecessor → current → successor chain thinking

### When Activated
- Phase 2: Creating the index note
- Phase 3: Executing the Luhmann Scan

### Luhmann Scan (mandatory per note)
After creating each note, ask:
1. **Prerequisites**: What other notes do I need to fully understand this card?
2. **Potential connections**: What related concepts does this card imply?

Discovered notes → add to the next round's creation queue

### Acceptance Criteria
- Every note has ≥2 meaningful links
- All notes are reachable via indexes or structure notes
- The network contains "surprise" connections
