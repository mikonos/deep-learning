# [Book/Article Title] Structure Note

> **Parent Index**: [[Index_XXX]]  
> **Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
>
> **Context**: In YYYY-MM, due to [goal], organized the core argument structure of *[Title]*.
> **Default Reader**: Future self, six months from now — this structure is self-contained and memory-independent.

## 📋 Overview (5 Questions)
> Establish a global cognitive map; prevent getting lost in details.

1.  **What problem does it solve?** (Pain point / Scenario): 
2.  **What is the core mechanism?** (First principles): 
3.  **Key concepts (3–5)**: 
4.  **Comparison with known methods**: 
5.  **One-sentence summary (Feynman test)**:

## Core Propositions

> Mortimer Adler: "A good book should be reducible to a few core propositions."

1.  **Proposition 1**: [Summary]
2.  **Proposition 2**: [Summary]
3.  **Proposition 3**: [Summary]

## Logic Tree

<!--
> **Luhmann Scan Guide**:
> *   Theory / Concept → create **Atomic Note** ([[ConceptName]])
> *   Tool / SOP → create **Method Note** ([[MethodName]])
-->

Proposition 1 (Premise)
├─ [[Atomic Note A]] — Evidence / Mechanism
└─ [[Method Note B]] — Actionable Tool / SOP

Proposition 2 (Core Argument)
├─ [[Atomic Note C]] — Core Model
└─ [[Atomic Note D]] — Rebuttal / Qualification

Proposition 3 (Conclusion / Application)
├─ [[Method Note E]] — Solution
└─ [[Method Note F]] — Practice Guide

## Reading Sequence

> Each step includes a "reason": six months from now, you'll still understand why the next step follows.

### Sequence A: [Topic Name]
1.  **[[Note A]]** (Premise)
    > Reason: Establishes foundational concepts...
2.  **[[Note B]]** (Argument)
    > Reason: Unpacks the core mechanism...

### Sequence B: [Topic Name]
...

## Gap Analysis

> Are there any leaps in the argument chain?

-   [ ] Between Sequence A → B, missing [[Potential Note X]]
-   [ ] [Other findings]

## 🏛️ Expert Debate
> **L3 Deep Debate**: Simulate a debate among Musk (physics lens), Socrates (definitional probing), Munger (inversion), and Feynman (explanation) on the book's core claims.

*   **Musk**: [Challenge from first principles / physical constraints]
*   **Socrates**: [Probing the definitions of core concepts]
*   **Munger**: [Invert — what are the hidden risks / adverse effects?]
*   **Feynman**: [Can X be explained with a simpler metaphor?]
*   **Author (Proxy)**: [Response]

> **Conclusion / Reframe**: [Post-debate consensus or open questions]
